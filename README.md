# microbit-projects
A collection of small projects written in MicroPython to be run on micro:bit.

## Introduction
You'll need an micro:bit V2 to execute these projects. If you don't have a micro:bit, you could
visit https://python.microbit.org/ and run the code in the web emulator.

## Projects
A short description of the projects.

### find_me_by_brightness
You are a spot on the 5x5 LED matrix and have to find a hidden target position. The brightness of
the spot increases as you get closer to the target.

**Controls:**
- Button A: Move spot by one step
- Button B: Turn spot right

This is my very first micro:bit project.

### play_a_song
Move a spot to the left or to the right to play a song.

**Controls:**
- Button A: Move left
- Button B: Move right
